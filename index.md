<p>In 1865, Captain Savage wrote the book titled <em>A chronological history of the Boston watch and police, from 1631 to 1865; together with the Recollections of a Boston police office, or, Boston by daylight and gaslight, from the diary of an officer fifteen years in the service. By Edward H. Savage.</em></p>
            
<p> Above details about Captain Savage are generally known.

            <h2>Foundation of Boston Police in 1854 and Captain Edward H. Savage</h2>
            
<p>Until 1854, Boston's policing was handled by the City Watch, a volunteer system of patrol and policing.<br> </p>
<p>However, in 1854, it was replaced by a police system modelled after the London's Metropolitan police. According to <a href="https://police.boston.gov/history/">Boston Police's history</a> page.<br> </p>
            
<p>The police station at 152 North Street, North End was known as the <em>Boston Police Station Number One</em>. Edward Savage (left photo) was the first captain of this police station. Captain Savage was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief in 1861.<br>In 1870, to the title of Chief of Police. He retired in 1878.<br></p><p>He was keen about the history of Boston and wrote two major works about the history of policing in Boston.</p>

## Why is this archive important?

Captain Savage's ledger isn't just another dusty old record book – it's a goldmine of information that you simply can't find anywhere else. Here's why this collection matters:

* **Unique data that's impossible to find elsewhere.** While we know the broad strokes of how Boston's police department was formed in 1854, Captain Savage's day-to-day records show us what actually happened on the streets. This isn't history written by officials looking back – it's the real-time documentation of how America's early police forces actually worked.

* **Incredibly detailed and well-organized records.** Savage was meticulous about his record-keeping. His ledger gives us a systematic look at arrests, crimes, and public services in Boston's North End during the 1850s. The level of detail is remarkable – you can see crime patterns and understand how the new police force was finding its footing.

* **A window into 1850s Boston life.** Beyond just police work, these records capture daily life in one of Boston's most vibrant neighborhoods. You'll find stories of ordinary people dealing with extraordinary times – a city transforming from colonial town to modern metropolis.

* **Missing piece of American policing history.** The Burns Library dataset from 1855-59 covers those crucial early years when cities across America were figuring out how to do modern policing. Boston was among the first, and Captain Savage's records show us how they actually made it work.

* **Accessible to everyone.** The archives are available to public at Burns Library at Boston College. But sometimes it is difficult to process all this information. The dataset helps anyone to just start working with the data quickly. 

Whether you're a history buff, a student researching 19th-century America, or just someone curious about how Boston became the city it is today, Captain Savage's ledger offers insights you won't find in any textbook.
