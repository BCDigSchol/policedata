            <h2>Foundation of Boston Police in 1854 and Captain Edward H. Savage</h2>
            
<p>Until 1854, Boston's policing was handled by the City Watch, a volunteer system of patrol and policing.<br>However, in 1854, it was replaced by a police system modelled after the London's Metropolitan police. According to <a href="https://police.boston.gov/history/">Boston Police's history</a> page:</p>
            
<p>The police station at 152 North Street, North End was known as the <em>Boston Police Station Number One</em>. Edward Savage (left photo) was the first captain of this police station. Captain Savage was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief in 1861.<br>In 1870, to the title of Chief of Police. He retired in 1878.<br><br>He was keen about the history of Boston and wrote two major works about the history of policing in Boston.</p>

<p>In 1865, Captain Savage wrote the book titled <em>A chronological history of the Boston watch and police, from 1631 to 1865; together with the Recollections of a Boston police office, or, Boston by daylight and gaslight, from the diary of an officer fifteen years in the service. By Edward H. Savage.</em></p>
            
<p> Above details about Captain Savage are generally known. But a less popular fact about Captain Savage is that he maintained a ledger for tracking arrests, crimes and public services provided by the new police force under his supervision. This website focuses on that ledger. We invite you to explore that ledger and find out more about the 19th century history of Boston police.</p>


## Archive details
Captain Savageâ€™s diary of monthly reports of the activity of the police is accessible to the public through the Burns Library archive at Boston College. The diary reports the activities of Police station one of North End, Boston. You can view the scanned version at the following link: [https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581](https://findingaids.bc.edu/repositories/2/archival_objects/47581).  

The diary includes a lot of information about the police activities during this time period. Including but not limited to: 
- Monthly report of arrests and public service duties conducted by the police (more on this in the [Data section](/policedata/data)
- Yearly reports summarizing the same data as above
- Details about the names and addresses of the police officers
- Updates about the number of stores (for instance, how many tailor shops in the police precinct area, etc.)
- Hierarchical structure of police during this time and the name of the person holding the top offices, including the mayor. 
- Drawings of the official police badge from the time period.
