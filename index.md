  <h2> North End Police Data (1854-59)</h2>
  
<p>This site makes public the records of Captain Savage, who led one of Boston’s first police stations in the North End from 1854–1859.</p>

<p>His meticulous log of arrests, crimes and the public service by the police offers a rare, ground-level view of city life and law enforcement in a rapidly changing American neighborhood.</p>

<p>We’ve cleaned and organized this unique dataset so you can search, explore, and ask new questions.
