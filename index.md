## Archive details
Captain Savageâ€™s diary of monthly reports of the activity of the police is accessible to the public through the Burns Library archive at Boston College. The diary reports the activities of Police station one of North End, Boston. You can view the scanned version at the following link: [https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581](https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581).  

The diary includes a lot of information about the police activities during this time period. Including but not limited to: 
- Monthly report of arrests and public service duties conducted by the police (more on this in the [Data section](/policedata/data)
- Yearly reports summarizing the same data as above
- Details about the names and addresses of the police officers
- Updates about the number of stores (for instance, how many tailor shops in the police precinct area, etc.)
- Hierarchical structure of police during this time and the name of the person holding the top offices, including the mayor. 
- Drawings of the official police badge from the time period.


## Diary looks like the following:

| Image showing the official police badge of the newly formed police department | Yearly Reports as found in the document |


However, most of the pages in the diary with the main information look like the following page:

One can see that the top left quadrant of the image highlights the demography of the arrests and lodgings provided. (For more details on what 'Lodgings' refers here, please take a look at this page_ **[ADD LINK TO THIS OR SOMETHING]. **_ For more details on how we use pages like these and turn them into a dateset, please visit the [Data page](/data).

## How to use this site?

For your best experience, we suggest the following uses to different pages:
- [Data page](/policedata/data): This is the heart of our website. It shows how we have made this dataset from the diary. And it shows you how you can download this dataset. 
- Example pages (Example 1 and Example 2): These pages are some of the ways in which you can use the data to deepen your understanding of the 19th century police work in Boston. This just scratches the surface of what is possible with a dataset like this.   
- [Interesting categories page ](/policedata/interesting_categories)- is a selection of categories that we believe might be super interesting to explore as a historian. There is a lot of interesting and weird stuff that can be found in this dataset, but these few categories, along with the example pages might help you start playing around with the data.   
- [Resources page](/policedata/resources): This dataset, when used in conjunction with other historical sources could be your starting point for a discovery about our past. This collection of resources about the city of Boston can help you make sense of this data in a wide variety of ways. We encourage you to explore these sites as well to help understand more about the role of police in this time period.

If you want to layout two images side by side, you can use Markdown's tables to organize them into a table of two or more columns... you can add rows for captions if you want.

| ![BCDS Logo](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp) | ![BCDS Logo](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp) |
| Caption 1 | Caption 2 |

If you want a single image, center aligned... you have to use raw HTML... use this as a guide, and replace the filename with yours
