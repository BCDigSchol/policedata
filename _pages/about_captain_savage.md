            <h2>Foundation of Boston Police in 1854 and Captain Edward H. Savage</h2>
            
<p>Until 1854, Boston's policing was handled by the City Watch, a volunteer system of patrol and policing.<br> </p>
<p>However, in 1854, it was replaced by a police system modelled after the London's Metropolitan police. According to <a href="https://police.boston.gov/history/">Boston Police's history</a> page.<br> </p>
            
<p>The police station at 152 North Street, North End was known as the <em>Boston Police Station Number One</em>. Edward Savage (left photo) was the first captain of this police station. Captain Savage was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief in 1861.<br>In 1870, to the title of Chief of Police. He retired in 1878.<br></p><p>He was keen about the history of Boston and wrote two major works about the history of policing in Boston.</p>

<p>In 1865, Captain Savage wrote the book titled <em>A chronological history of the Boston watch and police, from 1631 to 1865; together with the Recollections of a Boston police office, or, Boston by daylight and gaslight, from the diary of an officer fifteen years in the service. By Edward H. Savage.</em></p>
            
<p> Above details about Captain Savage are generally known. But a less popular fact about Captain Savage is that he maintained a ledger for tracking arrests, crimes and public services provided by the new police force under his supervision. This website focuses on that ledger. We invite you to explore that ledger and find out more about the 19th century history of Boston police.</p>
