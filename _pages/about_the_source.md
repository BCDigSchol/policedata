The primary source for this project is the [Boston Police Station Number One (North End) Captain's record book, 1854-1859](http://hdl.handle.net/2345.2/MS2004_069_47581), located in and digitized by the [Burns Library](https://libguides.bc.edu/burns) at Boston College. The record book was kept by Edward Hartwell Savage, the then captain of the Boston Police Station Number One, which corresponds to the North End neighborhood in Boston in late 19th century. Boston Police Department was established in May 1854, and the record book starts in June 1854. This means that the record book documents police activity in North End right after the police department was first professionally established in Boston. 

Captain Savage’s diary of monthly reports of the activity of the police is accessible to the public through the Burns Library archive at Boston College. The diary reports the activities of Police station one of North End, Boston. You can view the scanned version at the following link: [https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581](https://findingaids.bc.edu/repositories/2/archival_objects/47581).  

The diary includes a lot of information about the police activities during this time period. Including but not limited to: 
- Monthly report of arrests and public service duties conducted by the police (more on this in the [Data section](/policedata/data)
- Yearly reports summarizing the same data as above
- Details about the names and addresses of the police officers
- Updates about the number of stores (for instance, how many tailor shops in the police precinct area, etc.)
- Hierarchical structure of police during this time and the name of the person holding the top offices, including the mayor. 
- Drawings of the official police badge from the time period.

## Why is this archive important?

Captain Savage's ledger isn't just another old record book – it's a goldmine of information that you simply can't find anywhere else. Here's why this collection matters:

* **Unique data that's impossible to find elsewhere.** While we know the broad strokes of how Boston's police department was formed in 1854, Captain Savage's day-to-day records show us what actually happened on the streets. This isn't history written by officials looking back – it's the real-time documentation of how America's early police forces actually worked.

* **Incredibly detailed and well-organized records.** Savage was meticulous about his record-keeping. His ledger gives us a systematic look at arrests, crimes, and public services in Boston's North End during the 1850s. The level of detail is remarkable – you can see crime patterns and understand how the new police force was finding its footing.

* **A window into 1850s Boston life.** Beyond just police work, these records capture daily life in one of Boston's most vibrant neighborhoods. You'll find stories of ordinary people dealing with extraordinary times – a city transforming from colonial town to modern metropolis.

* **Missing piece of American policing history.** The Burns Library dataset from 1855-59 covers those crucial early years when cities across America were figuring out how to do modern policing. Boston was among the first, and Captain Savage's records show us how they actually made it work.

* **Accessible to everyone.** The archives are available to public at Burns Library at Boston College. But sometimes it is difficult to process all this information. The dataset helps anyone to just start working with the data quickly. 

Whether you're a history buff, a student researching 19th-century America, or just someone curious about how Boston became the city it is today, Captain Savage's ledger offers insights you won't find in any textbook.
