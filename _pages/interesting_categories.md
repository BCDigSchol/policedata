In this page, we introduce explanations a few crime categories that were featured in the [police ledger](https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581) and appeared consistently in it. We were interested because of two reasons: 
1. Their unfamiliarity to contemporary readers
2. Many contemporary readers would not consider these as "crime" today.
  
At the end of this page we introduce a broader list of such categories that could be explored further by those who are interested in this topic. 

**Common night walker** is a category that we consistently encountered in the police ledger. The category refers to sex workers. it appears as a consistent arrest category in the police ledger indicates the criminalization of sex work in mid-19th century in Boston. According to the [1860 General Statuses of the Commonwealth of Massachusets](https://archive.org/details/generalstatuteso1860mass/page/820/mode/2up), if convicted, common night walkers would be required to serve for six months in a “house of correction”, “house of industry” or a “workhouse.”

**Idle and dissolute** is another interesting category of crime in the ledger. In the [1860 General Statuses of Commonwealth of Massachussets](https://archive.org/details/generalstatuteso1860mass/page/818/mode/2up), idleness and dissoluteness is associated with begging, as well as with “persons who neglect all lawful business and habitually misspend their time by frequenting houses of ill fame, gaming houses, or tippling shops.”

**Houses of ill fame** as a crime category come up frequently in the document. A house of ill fame refers to brothels. The category referred to the people who owned or administered such houses. according to the [1860 General Statuses of Commonwealth of Massachussets](https://archive.org/details/generalstatuteso1860mass/page/818/mode/2up), keeping a house of ill fame was punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of two years. 

**Lascivious cohabitation** is another interesting crime category that occurs frequently the records. From the descriptions in the [1860 General Statuses of Commonwealth of Massachussets](https://archive.org/details/generalstatuteso1860mass/page/818/mode/2up), we can infer that this category primarily refers to couples who live together but are unmarried. We have not found conclusive proof to definitely suggest that this also refers to homosexual couples. However, in the 1860 General statuses, the category is named as 'lewd and lascivious cohabitation', and  'lewdness' might be a way of referring to homosexuality in the 19th century. According to [1860 General statuses](https://archive.org/details/generalstatuteso1860mass/page/818/mode/2up), 'lewd and lascivious cohabitation' was punishable by up to three years in state prison, in jail up to two years, or by a fine of up to three hundred dollars.
