<center><h1>Boston Police Station Number One (North End) Monthly Reports <br> (June 1854-December 1859)</h1></center>

In this dataset, we have compiled the  monthly logs of Captain Edward H. Savage (1812-1893). It is derived from the archives available at [Burns Library](https://libguides.bc.edu/burns) at Boston College. We have turned the ledger of Captain Savage into a spreadsheet which allows it to be machine-readable and easy to work with. We have done this as follows:  

For instance, if the entry for June 1854 appears as follows:

We have tabulated the data in the following format:

## You can download the full data in a CSV format (can be opened in Excel) from [here](https://github.com/BCDigSchol/policedata/blob/main/data/police_data.csv)

  

The dataset can feel overwhelming at first, if you don't know where to start we would recommend you to check out a few of the [interesting categories](policedata/interesting_categories) page for some ideas. Or you can also check out our [examples](/policedata/examples).




    

## Notes about data:

We had to merge a few categories. We find it pertinent to share these details alongwith our reasoning of doing so. 
However, if you want to know how the data was presented exactly in the record-book - please refer to the [Burns Library Archive's scans](https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581) directly. Here is a table of some of the merged categories that we aren't too sure of.
