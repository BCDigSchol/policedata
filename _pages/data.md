<center><h1>Boston Police Station Number One (North End) Monthly Reports <br> (June 1854-December 1859)</h1></center>

This is our dataset made out of compiling the monthly logs of Captain Edward H. Savage (1812-1893). It is derived from the archives available at [Burns Library](https://libguides.bc.edu/burns) at Boston College. 

For instance, the entry for June 1854 appears as follows:

## You can download the full data in a CSV format (can be opened in Excel) from [here](https://github.com/BCDigSchol/policedata/blob/main/data/police_data.csv)

 

The dataset can feel overwhelming at first, if you don't know where to start we would recommend you to check out a few of the [interesting categories](policedata/interesting_categories) page for some ideas. Or you can also check out our [examples](/policedata/examples).

 

## Notes about data:

We had to merge a few categories as and when required. We find it pertinent to share these details with you with the reason why we have done so. 
However, if you want to know how the data was present exactly in the record-book - please refer to the [Burns Library Archive's scans](https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581) directly.
