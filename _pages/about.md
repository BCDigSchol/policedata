This website is a result of the project under ILA (Institute of Liberal Arts) internship at Boston College over Summer 2025. It is also supported by the Digital Scholarship Group at Boston College. 

The primary source for this project is the [Boston Police Station Number One (North End) Captain's record book, 1854-1859](https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/MS2004_069_47581), located in and digitized by the [Burns Library](https://libguides.bc.edu/burns) at Boston College. The record book was kept by Edward Hartwell Savage, then captain of the Boston Police Station Number One, which  corresponds to the North End neighborhood in Boston in late 19th century. Boston Police Department was established in May 1854, and the record book starts in June 1854, which means that the record book documents police activity in North End right after the police department was first professionally established in Boston.
